          <h2>1. General</h2>
          <p>All computer users (staff, students, and others) are expected to be responsible
            for their own behavior on the computer system, including the Internet, just as they are anywhere else in
            the college. Users are reminded that their actions can represent the entire college community. This
            includes materials they choose to access, language they use, ideas they express, and other actions which
            they take.</p>

          <h2>2. Uncertainty</h2>
          <p>If you are unsure of what to do, for instance in the case of an error message,
            a web site offer, a strange e-mail, a hardware malfunction, etc., ask a lab supervisor. It is better to
            wait and ask, than to take an action which will endanger yourself, the computer, or the network.</p>

          <h2>3. Administrative</h2>
          <ul class="stack" style="--stack-space:1rem">
            <li>
              <h4>No Noise</h4>
              <p>So that everyone can concentrate, noise must be kept to a minimum.
                Please do not let your phone ring, have conversations, or listen to music without headphones
                in the lab.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>No Open Access During Scheduled Classes</h4>
              <p>Students are not allowed in the open access lab when they have scheduled classes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>DO NOT:</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Unplug any cables</li>
                <li>Move devices from its original places</li>
                <li>Connect your devices inside laboratory instead of lab equipment</li>
                <li>Charge your devices with electrical outlets that are reserved for lab equipment</li>
                <li>Move tables</li>
                <li>Install any software without permission of Lab Administrator</li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Equal Access</h4>
              <p>It is common that there are not enough computers for the number of
                people who want to use them (more users than computers). In order to ensure that everyone
                has some opportunity to use the computers, please limit computer use to one hour, if there
                are people waiting. In order to manage this process, please observe the following:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Add your name to the bottom of the list.</li>
                <li>If there is a computer free, note the time you begin using the computer.</li>
                <li>If you are waiting, check if there is someone who began using the computer more than one hour ago. If there is, you may ask for this person and they should leave, then you can use the computer (note the time in the list).</li>
                <li>When you leave, please note the time you are finished.</li>
                <li>If no one is waiting, you may use the computer more than one hour.</li>
                <li>When you are asked to leave, you may add your name to the list again if you want to continue using the computer.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Please be respectful of your fellow students and help ensure that everyone has a fair chance to use the computers.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Broken Equipment</h4>
              <p>Do <b><i>not</i></b> try to repair equipment yourself. If you encounter problems with equipment, you should report this to the lab supervisor.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Cleanliness</h2>
          <p>Smoking, drinking, or eating in the lab can damage the equipment and attract insects or rodents.
            Liquids can be a reason of Fire!!! Please keep the lab neat; clean up any messes, use rubbish bins, and leave
            equipment and furniture properly arranged.</p>

          <h2>5. Inappropriate Content</h2>
          <p>Controversial content (e.g. pornography) is not appropriate in an academic setting.
            Users should expect that their browsing history will be recorded, and might be examined by system administrators.</p>

          <h2>6. Account Usage</h2>
          <p>Each user must have his / her own account. Accounts are not to be shared.
            This is for accountability and security. You must log out when you leave. Users should not access
            other people's files unless permission has been given by the file's owner. Programs (e.g. Yahoo
            Chat) may NOT be downloaded and installed from the internet. If you are unsure whether a web page
            is downloading a program, please ask a lab supervisor. This is for security and uniform lab
            maintenance. Personal program files may NOT be installed. This is for licensing and security reasons.
            Personal work files, such as documents, may be brought into the lab, but must be scanned for viruses
            prior to use, to prevent system infection. Ask a lab supervisor for details. Hacking (attempting to
            gain unauthorized access to secured content, violate system policies and/or permissions, virus
            creation or propagation, etc.) is prohibited.</p>

          <h2>7. Web Usage</h2>
          <p>Computer users browsing the World Wide Web are expected to avoid offensive materials.
            Should any user encounter any such material accidentally, they should report the circumstances immediately to an instructor.
            Users should expect that their browsing history will be recorded, and might be examined by system administrators.
            Users should note that the internet is available to all kinds of people, and that there are many scams and otherwise illegal or immoral
            activities on the internet. They should be just as cautious of information on the internet as they would be of information heard in the street
            from someone they don't know. Bandwidth is a limited resource. When throughput is slow, you may be asked to cease high-bandwidth activity
            (e.g. music downloading).</p>

          <h2>8. E-Mail Usage</h2>
          <p>Computer users should realize that, in their on-line communications, their actions may be interpreted to represent the college community.
            Therefore, users should not to use any rude language, or communicate any offensive ideas. Users should again note that the internet is
            available to all kinds of people, and there are many scams and otherwise illegal activity perpetrated through e-mail. E-mail from unknown
            persons should be received very cautiously. You are cautioned against giving out your personal information (such as name, phone, and address).
            It is forbidden to forward chain letters/e-mails. These are defined as any e-mail which states that it should be forwarded to others.
            These especially include warnings of viruses, worms, security warnings, etc. Such warnings will be sent by system administrators only.</p>

          <h2>9. Rules & Updates</h2>
          <p>These rules may be updated from time to time. Updates will be posted in the
            computer lab and on the web site. Users are responsible for being familiar with all rules, including
            new rules.</p>

          <h2>10. Common Sense</h2>
          <p>Again, you are responsible for your own behavior on the computer system. The
            above rules are not exhaustive, and even if a particular action is not listed above as prohibited, you
            must use your common sense&nbsp;— if it will reflect poorly on you or the college, if it will disturb others,
            or if it might damage computers or the network, <i><b>do not do</b></i> it.</p>

          <h3>Consequences of Violations</h3>
          <ul class="list-danger">
            <li>ejection from the lab</li>
            <li>suspension of computer privileges</li>
            <li>reporting to the college administration</li>
            <li>monetary reimbursement for damages</li>
